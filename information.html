                <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, often due to increased eye pressure, and is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. It can develop silently, with early stagesshowing few or no symptoms, though gradual loss of peripheral vision, blurred vision, halos around lights, or eye paincan occur. Types include the common open-angle glaucoma, the urgent angle-closure glaucoma, and normal-tensionglaucoma. People over 40, those with a family history, certain ethnic backgrounds, or health conditions likediabetes and high blood pressure are at higher risk.

                <h1>Diabetes</h1>
                <p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Normally, blood sugar (glucose) rises after eating, triggering insulin from the pancreas to help cells absorb it. In diabetes, the body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or can’t use it properly, leaving glucose in the blood, which over time can cause heart, kidney, nerve, and eye problems. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition requiring lifelong insulin, while Type 2, the most common form, is linked to genetics and lifestyle and can often be delayed with healthy habits like regular activity, balanced eating, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking. Symptoms can develop silently but may include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing cuts, or tingling in hands and feet. Diabetes is diagnosed through blood tests like fasting blood sugar, A1C, or glucose tolerance tests. Managing diabetes involves healthy eating, physical activity, monitoring blood sugar, and following treatment plans. Technology like apps and smart devices can help track progress. Early detection and regular checkups are key to living a healthier life.</p>
